1. Single number #136
Approch 1: Use HashSet, add a number if not contained and delete if that occurs for the second time. Element left in the hashset is the single element. But it uses O(n) space complexity. SO FAIL..!
Approach 2: Use Bit Manipulation

XOR all the numbers together. The result will be the single number. XOR same number gives 0 and so all numbers that occur twice cancels out and element left is single occurance number. 
XOR Rules: 0 ^ 0 = 0 and 1 ^ 0 = 1
